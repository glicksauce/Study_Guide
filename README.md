### Problem: 
I want to quiz myself on my study material but I accidentally keep revealing the answer, the questions always come in the same order, and the answers are always the same letter.
### General App Idea: 
A study guide that lets you add your study material and then turns it into flash cards
###  Who would use it: 
Students studying for a multpile choice exam

## MVP Checklist:

At least one model with all 7 RESTful routes and full CRUD.  
exclamation A git repository not inside the class repo.  
At least one Github commit per day.  
Be deployed online and accessible to the public via Heroku  
A README.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach was taken, unsolved problems, user stories, and notes to yourself so you can come back to your project later in the course and be able to pick up your train of thought, etc  
Have a link to your hosted working app in the README.md file in your github repo  
Include sign up/log in functionality, with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow
